# HomeWork
HomeWork is a Task Management Web app aimed at members of a household looking to distribute recurring pieces of work such as chores between its members. It was written as a coursework project for my university's Web Development module and scored 100%.

Though you can download the project and run it on your own AMP-stack server, you can also find a live demo at: https://cs139.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~u2002658/cs139/HomeworkApp/
